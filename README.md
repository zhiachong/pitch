### Pitch


### Idea
- buy / sell items that you like by swiping left/right
- model similar to [Massdrop][massdrop]
	- users are scrolling through and pick the items they might be interested in buying (they need to indicate what they are interested in)
	- then we approach dealers (someone) to seek the best price  
	- since they marked their interest, we now show them it's now open
- for users who don't want to just browse, there's an option to buy the items already on sale
- users are able to make suggestions on what to buy next, pick a price they're willing to pay for it (ballpark figure)
- can view the polls of what's the most sought after product, and at what price 

### Marketing
- we need to look for some local stuff or something to start putting it on the site to gain some traction
- get some input from dealers if they're willing to give discounts
- look at how massdrop does it and copy what they're doing 
	- their discounts are usually very minor but I don't think they buy the products. They're the middle man, and merely do [drop shipping] [drop] 

### Make money 
- deal with the dealers, take a cut of their profit
- advertiser products get a higher priority 
- we don't show people how we rank the products and which ones will get picked when, so if a dealer is willing to give us a bigger cut, we'll offer their product first
